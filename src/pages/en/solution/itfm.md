### IT financial management
### **must improve**

Digital transformation major challenge does not reside in new technology adoption, but in aligning business, finance and IT metrics on technology choice.

Whilst IT technologies are improving in every direction – technology, process, and activities – and Cloud services reach a mature level, **IT financial management improves slowly.**

IT is adapting according to enterprise needs, **but it does still not operate as an asset and service cost-effective provider.**

### Larger requirements on cost transparency

### Larger requirements on IT cost and IT cost transparency are now mandatory for the enterprise to remain competitive.

IT expense structure is becoming more and more complex (Cloud, IoT, Security, Big Data…), supply and outsourcing options are increasing. In the same time, **a growing proportion of technology investments are directly acquired and operated by business units increasing the risk for shadow IT.**

Whereas initiatives to setup an IT cost control organization, its role remains focused on budgeting and traditional supply processes that support IT operations.

Nevertheless, contributing to enterprise operations beyond "technical services" requires a deep understanding of what makes it successful and how priorities are managed to achieve business objectives.

### Strategic approach for IT financial governance and operation management

### Build a shared vision of IT costs and their value

Some IT departments are developing initiatives for an advanced service management: ITIL best practice, service monitoring and configuration management tools.
Nevertheless, these approaches are limited to IT department internal success, but enterprise IT services offering is still lacking commercial perspective and business dimension.

### A new approach is mandatory:

A new strategic approach must combine IT financial and IT operations management since IT organizations are moving towards a service centric management. Whilst assets and services lifecycle cost and related management complexity are strongly increasing, this strategic approach must efficiently encompass investment planning, risk, supplier and contract management as well as staff management to support final services delivered to business.

**IT Business and Financial Management solutions (ITFM-ITBM) like KP-One have been designed to enable this strategic approach execution.**

### Enterprise executive management has an increasing need for IT investments financial transparency

### CIOs are now implementing dedicated IT financial management tools that help them with becoming knowledgeable decision makers and trusted business partners within the enterprise
 
IT Business and Financial Management (ITBM-ITFM) software platforms have been designed to help enterprise with integrating IT department operational view with corporate Financial department financial data to finally improve IT cost and IT investment management and align them with business objectives.
 
Existing practice related to IT investment management, risk management and cost transparency has proved inefficient so far.

Whereas IT department is not a business itself, it is responsible for several business domains such as financial management, staff management, supplier and contract management. To be an efficient partner in enterprise strategy implementation, IT department must identify and manage its own service offering in terms of business value.
 
**From a financial stand point, IT financial transparency while demonstrating ownership and ability to manage IT investment is mandatory to gain credibility.**

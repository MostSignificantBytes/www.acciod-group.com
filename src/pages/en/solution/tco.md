### IT cost transparency relies on
### **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**

**Without TCO analysis, companies make far-reaching consequences errors in IT budget calculation and are not able to simulate a reliable transformation scenario.**
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) encompasses all cost flavors in product, equipment or service lifetime. Global TCO must also include both direct and indirect costs to achieve a complete cost.

IT financial transparency major goal is to obtain delivered services TCO to compare it with transformation projects ROI and materialize their real opportunity.

IT cost diversity, speed of change and complexity to aggregate, make TCO calculations unaffordable and non-repeatable. However, IT relies on specific rules that can be automated with a powerful software dedicated to IT financial management for bridging all TCO components.

**KP-One is a powerful software platform for IT Business Management (ITFM-ITBM) fully dedicated to enterprise Information System financial management.**

IT managers have many tools for managing day-to-day operations which data show to be fragmented and globally inconsistent. A major roadblock for getting a global view of enterprise IT asset consists in having a single data repository shared by enterprise stakeholders that aggregates technical and financial data that are fragmented and hosted in siloed sources.

### KP-One captures precisely total IT equipment's and IT services cost

Relying on its innovating and dynamic data model, KP-One handles all flavor of your IT data (Resources and cost types) in a single repository. Real costs attached to existing resources get visible, organized and understandable.
KP-One computes technology TCO relying on a usage rate that gathers all IT asset cost drivers.

A business case analysis is enabled by comparing analyzed IT perimeter total cost (infrastructure, Cloud, application landscape, workplace, telecomâ€¦) with forecasted architecture or delivery model.

### Cloud migration analysis by KP-One

**You wish, for example, to migrate away from a homegrown e-mailing system to a Cloud provided service**

KP-One builds and shows one IT perimeter TCO and compares with forecasted cost computed by IT business rules and anticipated consumptions. KP-One integrates transformation project cost to compute a comprehensive project ROI including break even and payback.

**Cloud migration is a standard KP-One use case that allows to track any project benefit, to compute upfront business case and monitor it during project execution.**

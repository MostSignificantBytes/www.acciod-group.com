![coding](/img/20220525_pixabay_coding_1.jpg)

We are pleased to present the third version of our site.

This new version is faster and more suitable for browsing from a smartphone or tablet. It is available in French and English (for now!).

This site has been designed according to the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture, in our case, we use the following technologies:

1. Gatsby (based on ReactJS and GraphQL) and Bulma frameworks
2. Code hosted on GitHub
3. Built and deployed on Netlify

## What's next

In addition to being faster and more up-to-date technologically, our new site is also ready to follow the next evolutions of MSB, we will tell you more about it soon.

Enjoy your visit !

intro:
  heading: Tailor-made solutions
  description: From hardware selection to configuration and go-live, we design and
    plan custom-made infrastructures. At MSB we take documentation, scalability
    and maintainability very seriously and we're glad to pass that knowledge to
    anyone.

      text: We believe every work must be based on precise and documented needs.
        Before doing any changes or adding new systems, we take measurements and
        analyse the current infrastructures in order to define precisely what
        needs to be improved and how it should be done.

      text: We design systems that are meant to last and to be scalable. By always
        keeping in mind that IT is there to support companies' evolutions, we
        make sure to plan the right architectures to address the right needs.

      text: Love a clean IT rack, but never knew how to do it? Bought a fancy new
        firewall but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we're here to
        help. We will set up and configure everything just the right way, you
        will never feel embarrassed to show you infrastructures to your
        colleagues anymore.

      text: Once new systems are up and running, we support your IT teams and the end
        users as long as required. Everything we do is meant to help your
        business to run and grow day after day, the best reward we can get is to
        know everything is up and running and you can focus on your work.

  heading: Great work with no compromises
  description: We hold your systems to the latest standards, from the first piece
    of cable to a state of the art infrastructure. That's why we're meticulous
    and transparent about each step of the setup. You're not there to test the
    last big name gadget just because the seller was nice, what matters for us
    is to know your business rellies on stable and resilient fundations.

  description: MSB is the IT partner for everyone who believes that network
    infrastructures shouldn't just work, they should empower people's work and
    grow up with them. We set up state of the art architectures and follow the
    best practices while making sure to get the best balance between security,
    user acceptance and cost according to our customers needs.

    plan custom-made infrastructures. At MSB we take documentation, scalability
    and maintainability very seriously and we're glad to pass that knowledge to
    anyone.

      text: We believe every work must be based on precise and documented needs.
        Before doing any changes or adding new systems, we take measurements and
        analyse the current infrastructures in order to define precisely what
        needs to be improved and how it should be done.
